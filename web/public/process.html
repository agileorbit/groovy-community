    <h1 id="wealljs-culture-and-process">Apache Groovy Community Slack Processes</h1>

    <p>Beyond the <a href="/coc.html">Code of Conduct</a>, there are a number of processes and cultural
        notes about how the Apache Groovy Community Slack handles regular community stuff, how it is organized, and all that.</p>

    <h2 id="channels">Channels!</h2>

    <p>In the interest of making the overall space as welcoming as possible for its members, and for the sake of doing
        our best to support the variety of individuals that are participating, the Apache Groovy Community Slack has a
        particular policy for channel management, structure, and administration.</p>

    <p>
        The conversations we have in Slack are incredibly valuable for the community. There may be discourse on
        new features, or support in fixing a bug, or rationale about why something is the way it is. We want to be sure
        that we preserve this record and make it available for everyone. To that extent, all public channels will be
        archived in a way that will be searchable by anyone in the future. (Private channels and direct messages will
        not logged or public.) This way, no mindshare is lost as our communication platforms continue to improve and evolve.
        You can view the archives on <a href="http://groovy-community.slackarchive.io" target="_blank">SlackArchive</a>.
    </p>

    <p>At its core, there are three channel types: "Resource" channels, "location-based" channels, and "others".</p>

    <h3 id="resource-channels">Resource Channels</h3>

    <p>Almost all public channels on the Apache Groovy Community Slack are considered "resource" channels. They are so named
        because they are considered to be important resources for individuals in the Apache Groovy community to have access
        to helping people find work and various tech-related channels for helping folks with questions that
        might involve work. As such, these public channels are more strictly policed than others: we consider it of
        prime importance that these channels are <strong>maximally accessible</strong> to community members because
        of the concrete career-related benefits they might provide.
    </p>

    <p>Since their scope is specific and limited, resource channels (and thus, all public channels) can only be created
        by Admins. If there's an idea for a resource channel you'd like to pitch or request, join
        <code class="highlighter-rouge">#meta</code> and discuss the idea, and an admin can help you make it (and
        announce it in <code class="highlighter-rouge">#general</code>)</p>

    <h3 id="prefixed-resource-channels">Location Based Channels</h3>

    <p>The next set of channels belong to a group of similar channels. The three main prefixes right now are
        <code class="highlighter-rouge">#conf-*</code> for any conferences, <code
                class="highlighter-rouge">#loc-*</code> for people either living in, or visiting those locations/places,
        and <code class="highlighter-rouge">#lang-*</code> for people who would like to discuss the Apache Groovy
        project in other languages.</code>
    </p>

    <h3 id="other-channels">Other Channels</h3>

    <p>Certain channels, some public, some private, have a special function beyond resources or identity channels:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">#admins</code> (private): A channel with all the slack admins in it. When a
            user uses the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/admins</code> command, or a new member signs up through the
            website, messages are sent to that channel to be processed by active admins. It is also the channel where
            private administrative discussion happens.
        </li>
        <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">#general</code>: This is the default channel that everyone in the
            community joins, and is unpartable. As such, only admins can post to it. Generally, there are three main
            categories of messages that will be posted there: New channels created, administrative meta-info that
            everyone should be aware of (policy or CoC changes, new admins, slack-wide requests of importance), and
            finally Apache Groovy Community Slack-related events or news that might be relevant to everyone.
        </li>
        <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">#meta</code>: General Apache Groovy Community Slack planning and management channel.
            This is the
            place for the community to discuss policy, usage, etc. It is not a place for reporting CoC violations.
            Please use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/admins</code> command for that.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p style="margin-top:50px;">Please note: This community is a privately run community and is not affiliated with the official Apache Groovy
        project.</p>

    <h1>The Community</h1>
    <p>The "Apache Groovy Slack Community" in this document refers to the Apache Groovy Slack Community organization at
        groovy-community.slack.com. "The administrators" refers to the administrators on this organization, a list is
        available at the top of the Team Directory (must be a member of the organization to view). This community is a
        privately run community and is not affiliated with the official Apache Groovy project.</p>
    <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
    <p>The Apache Groovy Slack Community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not
        tolerate harassment of participants in any form. This code of conduct applies to all Apache Groovy Slack Community
        spaces, including public channels, private channels and direct messages, both online and off. Anyone who
        violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the
        administrators.</p>
    <p>Some Apache Groovy Slack Community spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to
        participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules. Harassment includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental
            illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, national origin, ethnic origin,
            nationality, immigration status, language, religion or lack thereof, or other identity marker. This includes
            anti-Indigenous/Nativeness and anti-Blackness.
        </li>
        <li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food,
            health, parenting, relationships, drugs, and employment.
        </li>
        <li>Deliberate misgendering or use of "dead" or rejected names</li>
        <li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour</li>
        <li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like "hug" or "backrub") without
            consent or after a request to stop.
        </li>
        <li>Threats of violence</li>
        <li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage
            in self-harm
        </li>
        <li>Deliberate intimidation</li>
        <li>Stalking or following</li>
        <li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes</li>
        <li>Sustained disruption of discussion</li>
        <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
        <li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with
            others
        </li>
        <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>
        <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication</li>
        <li>Jokes that resemble the above, such as "hipster racism", still count as harassment even if meant satirically
            or ironically. See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160318232011/http://www.racialicious.com/2012/05/02/a-historical-guide-to-hipster-racism/"
                                  target="_blank">this article</a> for background.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Apache Groovy Slack Community prioritizes marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort. The
        administrators will not act on complaints regarding:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"Reverse"-isms, including "reverse racism," "reverse sexism," and "cisphobia"</li>
        <li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "I'm not discussing this
            with you."
        </li>
        <li>Communicating in a "tone" you don't find congenial</li>
        <li>Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Reporting</h1>
    <p>If you are being harassed by a member of the Apache Groovy Slack Community, notice that someone else is being harassed,
        or have any other concerns, please contact the administrators by typing 
        (<code class="highlighter-rouge">/admins &lt;your message&gt;</code>)
        in Slack, or contact an admin directly via DM. If the person who is harassing you is on the team,
            they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.
    </p>
    <p>This code of conduct applies to the Apache Groovy Slack Community spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of
        the Apache Groovy Slack Community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith
        reports of harassment by the Apache Groovy Slack Community members, especially the administrators, seriously. This
        includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team
        reserves the right to exclude people from the Apache Groovy Slack Community based on their past behavior, including
        behavior outside the Apache Groovy Slack Community spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the Apache Groovy Slack
        Community.</p>
    <p>In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to
        have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.
        We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we
        may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties
        about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of the Apache Groovy Slack Community members or the
        general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>
    <h1>Consequences</h1>
    <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in
        harassing behavior, the administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including temporary
        or permanent expulsion from all the Apache Groovy Slack Community spaces and identification of the participant as a
        harasser to other the Apache Groovy Slack Community members or the general public.</p>
    <h2 id="when-an-admin-gets-involved">When an Admin Gets involved</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Admin will identify themself as an admin of this community, and assert their role in maintaining the
            well-being of this space.
        </li>
        <li>The Admin will remind the user of the CoC and point out their behavior</li>
        <li>Admin should stick to/reference what was said in the conversation</li>
        <li>Admin should suggest an alternative behavior (rephrasing using specific language, moving the conversation to
            another channel if it's offtopic)
        </li>
        <li>If behavior persists, the violators will be removed from the specific channel (<code
                class="highlighter-rouge">/remove</code>).
        </li>
        <li>Admin will give them a warning via DM and have them read the CoC again.</li>
        <li>If a problem still persists with user after a warning, their account should be disabled for 12-24 hours,
            with an explanation to return after that time.
        </li>
        <li>If the problem still continues with a user, or the violation is so flagrant, endangering, or otherwise
            harmful, the user's account will be permanently disabled. Determining whether a violation is serious enough
            to warrant permanent banning is ultimately up to the admin, who should consult with those who felt harmed by
            the particular actions.

    <h2 id="the-community">The Community</h2>

<p>The “Groovy Slack Community” in this document refers to the Groovy Slack Community organization at groovy-community.slack.com. “The administrators” refers to the administrators on this organization, a list is available at the top of the Team Directory (must be a member of the organization to view).  This community is a privately run community and is not affiliated with the official Apache Groovy project.</p>

<h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>The Groovy Slack Community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. This code of conduct applies to all Groovy Slack Community spaces, including public channels, private channels and direct messages, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the administrators.</p>

<p>Some Groovy Slack Community spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.
Harassment includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, national origin, ethnic origin, nationality, immigration status, language, religion or lack thereof, or other identity marker. This includes anti-Indigenous/Nativeness and anti-Blackness.</li>
  <li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, relationships, drugs, and employment.</li>
  <li>Deliberate misgendering or use of “dead” or rejected names</li>
  <li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour</li>
  <li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.</li>
  <li>Threats of violence</li>
  <li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm</li>
  <li>Deliberate intimidation</li>
  <li>Stalking or following</li>
  <li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes</li>
  <li>Sustained disruption of discussion</li>
  <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
  <li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others</li>
  <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>
  <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication</li>
  <li>Jokes that resemble the above, such as ‘hipster racism’, still count as harassment even if meant satirically or ironically. See this article for background.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Groovy Slack Community prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. The administrators will not act on complaints regarding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Reverse”-isms, including “reverse racism,” “reverse sexism,” and “cisphobia”</li>
  <li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”</li>
  <li>Communicating in a “tone” you don’t find congenial</li>
  <li>Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reporting">Reporting</h2>

<p>If you are being harassed by a member of the Groovy Slack Community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the administrators by typing <code>/admins &lt;your message&gt;</code> in Slack, or contact an admin directly via DM. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.</p>

<p>This code of conduct applies to the Groovy Slack Community spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of the Groovy Slack Community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by the Groovy Slack Community members, especially the administrators, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from the Groovy Slack Community based on their past behavior, including behavior outside the Groovy Slack Community spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the Groovy Slack Community.</p>

<p>In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of the Groovy Slack Community members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>

<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including temporary or permanent expulsion from all the Groovy Slack Community spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other the Groovy Slack Community members or the general public.</p>
